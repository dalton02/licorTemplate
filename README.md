The Licor Template serves as a recommended structure for organizing your web applications when using the Licor Framework. It is designed with simplicity and best practices in mind, ensuring that even beginners can adopt it with ease while maintaining clean and scalable code.

It emphasizes modularity and separation of concerns, making it straightforward to manage complex projects.

  

### Key Practices in Licor Model

  

- Folder Structure:

  

	 - Organize your application into folders like controllers, services, models, and routes.

  

	- Each module has its own directory containing all related files (e.g., user, product, etc.).

  

- Separation of Concerns:

  

	- Keep business logic in services.

  

	- Use controllers for handling requests and responses.

  

	- Define data models and validation in models.

  

- Configuration:

  

	- Centralize configurations (e.g., database connections, environment variables) to ensure maintainability.
